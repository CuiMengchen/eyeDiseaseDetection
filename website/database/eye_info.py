introduction = ["Glaucoma is a group of diseases characterized by optic disc atrophy and depression, visual field "
                "defect and vision loss. Pathological increased intraocular pressure and optic nerve insufficiency are "
                "the primary risk factors for its onset. The tolerance of optic nerve to pressure damage Sex has also"
                " been linked to the onset and progression of glaucoma. Obstacles in any part of the aqueous humor "
                "circulation pathway can lead to pathological changes caused by elevated intraocular pressure, "
                "but some patients also present with normal intraocular pressure glaucoma. Glaucoma is one of the "
                "three leading causes of blindness in humans",

                "All kinds of reasons, such as aging, heredity, local nutritional disorders, immune and metabolic "
                "abnormalities, trauma, poisoning, radiation, etc., can cause lens metabolic disorders, resulting "
                "in lens protein denaturation and turbidity, which is called cataract. Obstruction cannot be projected"
                " on the retina, resulting in blurred vision. It is more common in people over 40 years old, and the"
                " incidence rate increases with age.",

                "Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of the most common microvascular complications of diabetes. "
                "It is the leakage and obstruction of retinal microvessels caused by chronic progressive diabetes, "
                "which causes a series of fundus lesions, such as microvascular tumors, hard exudates, cotton wool "
                "spots, neonatal Blood vessels, vitreous proliferation, macular edema and even retinal detachment. "
                "DR can be divided into proliferative diabetic retinopathy and non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy "
                "based on the presence or absence of abnormal new blood vessels emanating from the retina."]

              "the visual recovery after cataract surgery. A-type and B-type ultrasound can be used to find out whether "
